Summary
-------

An avid engineer. My interests span from software development to algorithms and mathematics. Challenging real life problems fascinate me. I love working with different levels of abstractions at once.

I'm currently at [Square](https://squareup.com). Leading many engineering teams - Payments, Visibility, and Data Infrastructure.
Before that, I founded Polychart, a data visualization startup focusing on interactive analysis.

While I was a student I interned in [various](https://google.com) [companies](https://wish.com) working on test automation, web development, and big data applications.

My current interests are:

* Data Warehousing
* Distributed Systems
* Database Systems, specifically Time-series Databases

At the end of the day, I'm a generalist in heart. I still have much to learn and I would love to dedicate my passion towards the company and the product that I believe in.
