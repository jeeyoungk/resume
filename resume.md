Summary
-------

An avid software engineer. My interests span from software development to algorithms and mathematics. Challenging real life problems fascinate me. I love working with different levels of abstractions at once.

I was very fortunate to have a diverse set of internship while attending University of Waterloo. Started off as a simple software engineer in test automation and web development, but I gradually specialized into infrastructures and big data applications. I spent a year after graduation on Polychart, a data visualization startup.

At the end of the day, I'm a generalist in heart. I still have much to learn, and I would love to dedicate my passion towards the company and the product that I believe in.
